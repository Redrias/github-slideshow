The purpose of this app is to provide a solution to automated and telemarketing calls.  

- Many services use phone numbers that repeatedly call an individual hoping to sell something and the best you can hope for is that telling them to put you on the “Do -
- Not Call” list actually works.  
- Most phones do not come with native call-blocking support. 
- There are other call-blocking apps, but they may charge a fee. 
- Will be supported on Android and Apple Markets.
